# Know-Your-Rep-
Final Project for COMM 4190

## **An AI intermediary between citizens and House Representatives by Michael Fuentes**

## **Introduction**

Throughout this semester, we have had the amazing opportunity to explore the logic, thought processes, and social interaction skills of censored and uncensored LLMs. Via my personal blog, I've particularly dug into the censored style of ChatGPT 4.0, specifically its capability to passively mediate and adjust its langauge to avoid conflict in the face of misinformation. With this insight, I've conducted a blog evaluating whether censored and uncensored LLMs are politically inclined, ultimately finding GPT 4.0 (now 4.1) to not be politically inclined, erring on the side of information granting above emotions. 

Therefore, I present the ultimate unbiased political information granter: "Know Your Rep", an LLM application that assists individuals of all ages in learning who their rep is, what they support, and their current focuses in their term of office.

## **Know Your Rep's Agent Value Description**

### **Background**

In a political landscape filled with fearmongering politicians, booming news articles on the cons and cons (not too many pros are discussed) often in political debates, it can be very difficult to feel properly represented, let alone know who actually represents you. As we know senators represent us at a state level, but what about house reps? House representatives are some of the most local leaders in the United States who can have a semblance of great political impact on issues that truly matter to us. And so, with a somewhat lack of publicized resources to help people learn who their house representative is and what they believe in, this is where the agent value of "Know Your Rep" comes in. 

In the past, I believe AI has been unable to replicate real-world phenomenon and political discussions simply because present news sources had moved faster than AI can be informed. But nowadays, with broader databases fromt the internet that can be funneled to LLMs, we can create a censored and unbiased LLM assistant ready to help many understand who represents them and if their personal beliefs aligns with their house representative.

### **Motivations behind "Know Your Rep"**

Earlier in the semester, I'd met with Daniel Kai, a recent college graduate who'd created a policy start-up offering an interactive web forum for people from varying U.S. political stances to discuss ongoing political news and legislation. I learned of the process he was taking to help people learn about local news, but was curious to learn if there would be any automated strategies for helping inform such a user base about where they should seek news and information from. Thus, within the context of this final project, I hope for this LLM to simulate the experience of a curious user base exploring this policy startup and wanting to learn more about their house rep to inspire public discourse.
