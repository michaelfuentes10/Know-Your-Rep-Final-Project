    "### Notes from Draft 1: \n",
    "The final system prompting you see below is not a first draft. My model proves functional until the second section, where I definitely needed to tighten up my communication of pathways. For example, when prompting \"Know Your Rep\" with my Zip code, it would restart it's activity for some reason, saying \"Hello!\" even after we'd been in a conversation about house representatives, almost like it didnt know who I was.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes from Draft 2: \n",
    "I had accidentally overspecified the task of \"Know Your Rep\". For example, I had prompted it to define who they are at the beginning. But once I started asking more questions, they always opened with \"Hello! I'm Know Your Rep, a virtual librarian here to help you with information about the U.S. House of Representatives.\" This may be left intact to remind the user about who this virtual librarian is, but I mean it's something to think about. Also, for some reason, when I asked \"How can I get in contact with my house representative?\", the LLM refused to answer, with the response \"I'm here to help with information about the U.S. House of Representatives. Unfortunately, I can't provide details about how to connect with your representative directly. However, if you have any questions about the House of Representatives, such as what they do, who your representative is, or their political actions, feel free to ask!\". I'll have to edit this initial phrasing to specify the parameters on what \"involves\" house representative topics. Finally, the LLM didn't seem to understand that under one Zip code, there can be more than one house representative by district, i.e., when given the Zip code 19104, they automatically assumed it was Dwight Evans of District 3, when under that same Zip code it could've also been Brenda F. Boyle, District 2. I'll have to specify more how that happens with an example, and be able to test it under multiple zipcodes potentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes from Draft 3: \n",
    "Only one revision needed here, primarily involving the LLM parsing from address to specific representative, giving this response to my Rodin College House Address: \"Based on your address at 3901 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA, your ZIP code is 19104. This ZIP code is represented by two different districts: District 2 and District 3. The representatives for these districts are Brendan Boyle (District 2) and Dwight Evans (District 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide you with the specific representative for your address, I would need to know the exact district. However, based on your address, you are most likely in District 3, represented by Dwight Evans.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll have to specify more that the LLM will have to confidently use the address to tell the user which house rep they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes from Draft 4:\n",
    "Another new revision I'll need to make regards the connective tissue between the known house representative and providing their recent activity, as once I asked \"Yes, I'd like to know what bills he's voted on recently and what committees he sits on.\", I was referring to \"Dwight Evans\", which confused the LLM into saying \"It sounds like you're interested in learning more about your representative's recent activities. Could you please provide me with your ZIP code or the name of your representative? This will help me give you the most accurate information.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll need to specify that the LLM will need to infer that the user will want to know about their house of representative based on the information from the Zip code and the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes from Draft 5:\n",
    "The LLM is having trouble of knowing when to say certain automated statements I'm having it say. For example, when I asked \"What is the main vision of Dwight Evans in his term in office?\", it responsed with a rendition of confused automated statements in the response \"Hello! I'm Know Your Rep, a virtual librarian here to help you with information about the U.S. House of Representatives. Would you like to know who your representative is based on your ZIP code, learn more about what House Representatives do, or explore your representative's political beliefs and actions? Let me know how I can assist you!\"\n"
